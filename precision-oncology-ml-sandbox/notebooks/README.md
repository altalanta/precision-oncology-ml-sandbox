This folder can host lightweight analysis notebooks summarizing metrics and visualizations.

Examples to consider:
- Genomics: ROC/PR curves per fold, coefficient inspection
- Imaging: Grad-CAM gallery
- NLP: Top retrieved docs per query
- RL: Returns vs. episodes, policy heatmaps

Keep notebooks deterministic (seeded) and small so they run fast on CPU.
